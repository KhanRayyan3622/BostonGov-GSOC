1. Requesting City Services via AI-Driven Apps
Residents of Boston can request a variety of non-emergency services through the City’s 311 system. 
Annually, more than 300,000 requests flow into 311. These include requests for street sweeping, litter pickup, pothole repair, parking enforcement, and dozens of other services. 
Residents request services by calling our 311 contact center, going to our website, or using the 311 app.

The City believes that we can greatly improve the 311 experience by including AI-based image-recognition in our 311 apps. We envision a future where all a resident has to do is snap a photo of a problem they want to remedy. 
The AI will analyze the photo, determine the problem, and allow the user to submit a request in seconds. City staff would also benefit from this AI, as miscategorized 311 submissions can lead to mistaken deployment of resources.
To help bring this to life, a Google Summer of Code contributor will build and train an AI model based on the hundreds of thousands photos submitted to Boston’s 311 system over the last several years. 
The AI will be capable of analyzing images users submit and determining the type of services they are most likely to be requesting.

This project requires knowledge of AI-based image processing and associated libraries and tools. The trained model must be turned into a performant API that can be accessed through a Web or App-based UI. 
Advanced app-building experience is not necessary, but we will a basic app to test the model on a variety of devices in varying conditions.
